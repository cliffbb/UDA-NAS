<h1 style="text-align: center;">Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Architecture Search with Self-Training for Land Cover Mapping</h1>

<p>We proposed a simple UDA-NAS framework to search for lightweight neural networks for land cover mapping tasks under domain shift. The framework integrates Markov random field neural architecture search into a self-training UDA scheme to search for efficient and effective networks under a limited computation budget. The paper is <a href="(https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14704)">here</a>.</p>

### Requirements
The code depends on the packages in the `requirements.txt` file. 
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the packages.


### Overview
* Some packages are difficult to install and they are only used in data preprocessing, e.g. `osgeo`. You do not have to install all packages if you are not interested in some datasets. Please refer to `preprocess.py` and comment out the related code lines.

### Dataset
* Preprocess a dataset

```Shell
python preprocess.py func data_dir
```

For example

```Shell
python preprocess.py Land "/Users/whoami/datasets"
```

* The data hierachy before and after the preprocessing should be as follows. Please refer to `preprocess.py` for more details.

```

```

### Usage
#### Learning
* Learning a MRF

```Shell 
python search.py
```

### Inference
* Inference over the learnt MRF

```Shell
# diverse 5-best inference
python inference.py --m 5 --lam 10
# diverse 10-best inference
python inference.py --m 10 --lam 20
```

### Training
* Train a found architecture

```Shell
# MRF-UNetV1
python train.py --choices "8,9,2,4,0,4,8,6,2,1,8,3,3,3,0,7,5,1,8,2,0,3,0,1,4,0"
# MRF-UNetV2
python train.py --choices "8,8,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,0,8,1,0,8,1,0,8,1,0,8,1"
```
The FLOPs and FPS (frames per second) were computed on 1024x1024 RGB input data. 
The inference speed was computed on a single NVIDIA Tesla P100 (DGX-1) with 16 GB
memory based on an average runtime of 300 iterations with 10 iterations warm-up

* If you just want to benchmark with MRF-UNets, copy `models/mrf_unet.py` and `models/ops.py` into your codebase and add the following statements into your training script

```Python
from models.mrf_unet import ChildNet
model = ChildNet(image_channels, num_classes, channel_step, choices)
```
